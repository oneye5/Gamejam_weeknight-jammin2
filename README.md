## Block Blitz
This is a simple game made for a gamejam, developed in Godot 4.3 for both web(unstable) and windows.

Because Godot's export of the web build is extremely buggy, I have seperated the desktop and web versions, because in order to get the web build to work I had to remove most of the objects.

The song and 3d mesh's are not mine, credit is linked on the itch page. The rest is all my own work.
